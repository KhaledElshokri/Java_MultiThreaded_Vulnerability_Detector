# Java_MultiThreaded_Vulnerability_Detector

  ğŸ’­ Imagine you have a log file that conatains all users' 256 byte hash login keys to your system with their time stamps...

  ğŸ˜´ On a friday afternoon you realise that there is a security breach of your system, and all you have is that 200,000 line log file of the past week's Logs... ğŸ¥´

  ğŸ¤© Luckly you have some old hash keys that were found in passed breachs, you give this program the log file and the suspected hash... ( the hash is less than 256 bytes and can be non consecitive)

  ğŸ’£ And then boom you have a fast response from a multithreaded program that gives you the number of vulnerabilities in your logs and on which lines you can find them :)
